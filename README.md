Chinese restaurant idea
I was getting tired of seeing small restaurants using a pdf of their menu as their 'menu' page for their website. Here is my take on a possible layout. 

The home page layout, I was really experimenting with doing a header navigation bar that appears as the user scrolls down, remaining fixed to the top, then disappears as the user scrolls back up. 

I used a custom child theme to practice with. 

I left the Divi WordPress standard primary navigation in place for now, just to keep things easier to use as I'm fine tuning the layouts.
